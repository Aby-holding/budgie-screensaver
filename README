budgie-screensaver
==================

Yes I hate myself for creating this, but this is basically a fork of gnome-screensaver
which is completely dead, and we need a drop-in replacement of gnome-screensaver
with fixed bugs to use for Budgie.

Upstream previously indicated[1] the only way to go is a fork, they're not
planning on taking patches.

TL;DR Emergency fork to hold up Budgie 10, we'll do something less insane when
it comes to Budgie 11.

The overwhelming majority of the patches are ported from Ubuntu's package-fork of
gnome-screensaver to allow a simple drop-in replacement for the gnome-screensaver
package.


**UNLESS ANYONE WANTS THIS AS A PACKAGE, WE'LL JUST APPLY THE PATCHES BACK ON
TOP OF OUR OWN gnome-screensaver PACKAGE**
