The GNOME Screensaver DBUS API
------------------------------

This API is currently unstable and is likely to change in the future.

GNOME Screensaver exposes a DBUS API for programs to obtain
information about the screensaver state and to interact with
the screensaver in limited ways.

The following constants are used to uniquely refer to the
GnomeScreensaver object when making DBUS method calls:

DBUS Service:			"org.gnome.ScreenSaver"
DBUS Object Path:		"/org/gnome/ScreenSaver"
DBUS Interface:                 "org.gnome.ScreenSaver"

Examples
========

You can get the number of seconds the screensaver has been active by
running the following:

dbus-send --session \
          --dest=org.gnome.ScreenSaver \
          --type=method_call \
          --print-reply \
          --reply-timeout=20000 \
          /org/gnome/ScreenSaver \
          org.gnome.ScreenSaver.getActiveTime


You can activate the screensaver like so:

dbus-send --session \
          --dest=org.gnome.ScreenSaver \
          --type=method_call \
          --print-reply \
          --reply-timeout=20000 \
          /org/gnome/ScreenSaver \
          org.gnome.ScreenSaver.setActive \
          boolean:true


You can monitor screensaver changes:

dbus-monitor --session \
          "type='signal',interface='org.gnome.ScreenSaver'"


Or watch for a specific screensaver signal:

dbus-monitor --session \
          "type='signal',interface='org.gnome.ScreenSaver',member='ActiveChanged'"
